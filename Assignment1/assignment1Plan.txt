Grades & Evaluation
Students will be assessed based on programming as-
signments, in-class tests, a midterm exam and a final
exam. The final exam will cover all material taught
in the term. The final grade (G) will be calculated as
shown below using:
• A = average score on assignments
• T = average score on in-class tests
• M = score on the midterm exam
• F = score on the final exam
Calculate:
E = 0.4 × F + 0.2 × M + 0.1 × T
70
The final grade G is:
E if E < 60

(1 −W )E +WA if 60 ≤ E < 80

0.4F + 0.2M + 0.1T + 0.3A if E ≥ 80

where
W = E − 60
20 × 0.3

Important Notes:
• If the combined scores of tests and exams E < 60%,
the final grade will be below 60%. This means that a
student needs to earn at least 60% on the combined
tests and exams (E) to pass the course.
• When E ≥ 80%, the weight of tests and exams will
be 70%, and the weight of assignments will be 30%.
• Finally, when E is between 60% and 80%, the weight
of assignments will increase based on the student’s
performance on tests and exams from 0% to a maxi-
mum of 30%, and the weight of tests and exams will
also decrease from 100% to 70% accordingl
